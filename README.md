<p>
The famous & widely used <b>OpenGL</b> graphics library lacks support for drawing text. Then how can we draw text?? A solution to this problem would be to use the <b>Canvas Draw (CD)</b> library, which is a free library for drawing arbitrary graphics.
</p>
<p><b>Canvas Draw (CD)</b> is a vector graphics toolkit with device independent output. Developed by a Brazilian software company <b>Tecgraf/PUC-Rio</b>, it has the ability to draw text as well as general-purpose graphic primitives. It is implemented in several platforms using native graphics support: <i>Microsoft Windows (GDI)</i> and <i>X-Windows (XLIB)</i>.
</p>
<p>For text drawing, CD internally uses <b>FreeType</b>, an open-source and efficient font rendering engine.
</p>
<p>
This is a simple demonstration on how to draw ASCII Text as well as other graphic elements on the graphic canvas using CD.
