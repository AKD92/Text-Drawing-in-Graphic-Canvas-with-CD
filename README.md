Text Drawing on Graphic Canvas with CD Toolkit
</h1>

<h4 align="justify">
The famous & widely used <i>OpenGL</i> graphics library lacks support for text drawing functions.
<br>
So how can we <i>draw text ??</i>
<br>The solution to the problem would be simpler if we use <i>CD</i> toolkit.

<p align="justify">
<b>Canvas Draw (CD)</b> is a vector graphics toolkit with device independent output. Developed by a Brazilian software company <b>Tecgraf/PUC-Rio</b>, it has the ability to draw text as well as general-purpose graphic primitives. It is implemented in several platforms using native graphics support: <i>Microsoft Windows (GDI)</i> and <i>X-Windows (XLIB)</i>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
For text drawing, CD internally uses <b>FreeType</b>, an open-source and efficient font rendering engine.
</p>
<p align="justify">
CD contains functions to support <b>both vector and image</b> applications, and the visualization surface can be either a window or a more abstract surface, such as Image, Clipboard, Metafile, PS, and so on.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This is a simple demonstration on how to draw <b>ASCII Text</b> as well as other graphic elements on the canvas using CD.
